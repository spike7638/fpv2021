.Prove Prop 1.2 (two distinct lines have at most one point in common)
.Prove Prop 1.2A. An affine plane has at least four points

.Maybe try to define "pencil" (or "affine-pencil")

.Think about how to define the "type" for points in the completion of an affine plane. Or just how to write the theorem
for a single (assumed) affine plane. 

Cleanup: Merge Dhruv's version with my most recent notes about "out_param", etc., and start to be more judicious about
keeping a single track of progress. Move the A4 stuff into a separate file that imports affine_geom. 

Include mathLib in the github repository (or tell Dhruv that it's there).

Try to shorten the A4 proof using taut.

Write a solution to Exercise 1 so that we can use it to fill in the last of the "sorry"s from my session 
with Dhruv on 2/4. 

Try to shorten the "there are four points on any a-plane" proof by writing lots of little lemmas
Follow Rob's guidance that most proofs are 3-5 lines long.
