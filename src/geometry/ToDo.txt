Prove Prop 1.2 (two distinct lines have at most one point in common)
Prove Prop 1.2A. An affine plane has at least four points
Maybe try to define "pencil" (or "affine-pencil")
Try to shorten the A4 proof using taut? 

Think about how to define the "type" for points in the completion of an affine plane. Or just how to write the theorem
for a single (assumed) affine plane.
